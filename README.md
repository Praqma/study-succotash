# study-succotash

## About

An evolving repository with experiences, tips, trick and knowledge about infrastructure as code.

_Now it stops - no more manual hacks of infrastructure, we will script the hole world and share our experience through this repository as simple markdown files, drawing etc._

For now we are looking at Chef, not a specific reason, as both Puppet, Salt, Ansible and many other tools could be even relevant. We are focusing on the concepts.

## Chef DK 

We made a Chef DK in a container, so it is easy to use the Chef DK without installing local tools.

See how to build and use it here (there is yet no official images from us): [docker/praqma-docker-chefdk/README.md](/docker/praqma-docker-chefdk/README.md)

## Collaboration

We will work from issue so all of us can follow and contribute, so for example please ping your colleague if you already know how the issue he/she describe or have valuable inputs.

Our definition of done for allowing us to integrate is nothing - we only take notes etc.

## Study-succotash ?

And the repository name? Well github told me that a good name is short and memorable and suggested 'sturdy-succotash' - I removed the 'r' as this is about a _study_ in infrastructure as code :-)
Repository will evolve, and we will find a better name later.

Actually funny also that Chef have food names, and the github repo suggest something with succotash, which is a dish.
